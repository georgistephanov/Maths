I started this project to use it as a playground for what I currently learn at university - Java and Maths.
I started learning Linear Algebra in my spare time and plan on continuing with other university level math courses, as we aren't going
to study lots of maths at university. I will try to write functions for stuff I learn which I find challenging in order to deepen
my knowledge in the subject and at the same time practice some Java programming. In one of the most influential books I had read
so far - "A Mind for Numbers", Barbara Oakley says that the fastest way to fully understand something is to teach it to someone who has 
no knowledge of the subject (she uses a 5 year-old as an example). This is what I'm putting to practice here.
