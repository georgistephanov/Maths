/**
 * This is a project in which I will try to reflect what I learn in my spare time.
 * I started learning Linear Algebra and plan on continuing with other university
 * level Maths and will try to write functions for (almost) everything I learn in
 * order to deepen my knowledge. In one of the most influential books I had read
 * so far - A Mind for Numbers, Barbara Oakley says that the fastest way to
 * thoroughly understand something is to teach someone who has no knowledge of
 * the subject (like a 5 year-old). Who better to teach than a computer? :)
